== Contributions of Leo Kling

I was initially assigned as a member of the game development team, with the expectation that my primary focus would be on gameplay logic, level design, and related mechanics. According to the initial planning, I was listed as a human resource on all work packages except for `Node Types` and `Execution` and the `First Prototype`. However, due to persistent gaps in participation and accountability within the team, I ultimately contributed to nearly every aspect of the project.

In practice, I worked across both node development and game development. My responsibilities expanded to including implementing editor functionality, ensuring integration between components, backend logic, and debugging. Often outside the original scope of my role. This shift was not a strategic choice but a necessity. Several team members consistently failed to deliver their assigned tasks or were absent entirely, leaving critical gaps that I had to fill to keep the project moving forward.

This imbalance led to a highly uneven workload distribution and forced a small subset of contributors (myself included) to shoulder the majority of the development effort.

=== Time Tracking Methodology<leo_time_methodology>

Similiarly to the approach taken by Jonathan (@jonathan_time_methodology), I have been quite conservative in my time estimation. I have used pessimistic estimates for all untracked efforts to ensure that my reported contributions do not exceed the time actually spent.

Unlike a typical office environment, where an 8-hour shift may include breaks or periods of lower productivity, my time tracking reflects only focused, task-specific work. Breaks and non-productive intervals were deliberately excluded.

For programming-related work carried out prior to the start of formal time logging, I utilized a Git-based time estimation algorithm, as detailed in @jonathan_est_tracked_efforts.

=== Concept and Design<leo_des_phase>

During the concept and design phase, I became involved in areas beyond my original assignment. Although I was initially not responsible for prototyping or wireframing, I contributed extensively to the shared Figma document, which we used as a central platform for design collaboration. The wireframing process was approached rather loosely and without a clear structure early on, so I stepped in to help bring more coherence and direction.

Jonathan created new wireframes which I reviewed and provided feedback on, adding my thoughts where I felt improvements were necessary. One key concern I raised was about the structure of the early prototypes: they included a traditional "Start Game" screen and a level selection view. This approach didn't make much sense to me given that we were building a web-based experience. I argued that a website should begin with a proper landing page to provide context and information about the project. After discussing this in the group, we agreed to prioritize the design of a landing page.

Following that decision, Jonathan and I each wireframed a version of the landing page, and we also collaborated on a wireframe for the documentation page. However, as the wireframing process became stagnant, we decided to shift our focus and created a full visual design for the landing page, going beyond low-fidelity prototypes. Leo later implemented this design in code. Eventually, the layout was refined by Jonathan to better accommodate a growing number of levels and to reduce unnecessary visual clutter.

In addition to my contributions to the site and documentation design, I was also responsible for designing the visual style and layout of the nodes and the node editor. These designs were critical to the usability of the game interface and had to strike a balance between usability, functionality, and aesthetics. Alongside this, I also established the overall style and color scheme of the website, ensuring visual consistency across the node and web components.

Overall, while design was not my designated responsibility, I contributed meaningfully throughout the phase, especially in shaping the layout and structure of core parts of the user experience.
