  == Contributions of Markus Heming

  I was the one who came up with the initial idea for this project eventhough I declined to take the project lead. As we decided to mainly devide the project into two main parts, the node team and the game development team, I decided to put my main effort into the game development part as I I found it more suiting to my skills and interests.

  Besides the work packages that were assigned to the whole group I was mainly responsible for the `Game Design` and `Game Creation` part. So this was about the concept and design of the game, the development of the game itself and filling it with story. Later during the process I was also working on making the game as user-friendly as possible.

  Especially in the beginning I was kind of reliant on the progress of the node team in order to dive deeper into the game development part. This led to an uneven distribution of work in the beginning, which I had to compensate later on. Additionally to the higher time effort the main weight of the game progress was on my shoulders, due to the fact that members of the game development team had to work on other parts of the project as well and some lack of communication.

  In the following sections especially the @markus_dev_phase I'll focus more on the progress and the work I put into the project. This includes challenges I faced and also learnings I made during the project.

  === Time Tracking Methodology <markus_time_methodology>

  Similar to the other team members I tried to not overestimate my time spent on tasks and rather focus on actual time spent. For example as I was responsible for the game design part I tried to not count the time I spent on thinking about the game design in general, but rather only the time I spent on actually writing down the design and concept. This way I tried to get a more realistic view of my time spent on tasks.
  Due to this approach I also tried to not count the time spent on discussions with other team members when not actively working on the project.

  Later during the project the whole team agreed on using a google sheet to track our time and the tasks we worked on during that time. This made it easier to keep track of your own time and also to see what other team members are currently working on. Additionally it made it easier to see how much time was spent on each task and to identify potential bottlenecks in the project.

  At the end I also used the the same Git-based time tracking tool, described in @jonathan_time_methodology, to track my time spent on the programming and documentation tasks.

  === Project Planning<markus_project_planning>

  I was deeply involved in the project planning phase, being part of all sections including project schedules, setting up work packages and so on. I was also participating in online meetings and the in-person presentations of the project plan.

  === Concept and Design<markus_concept_design>

  At the beginning of the concept and design phase I started creating a first wireframe showing an example of the landing page and the level selection screen. This was mainly to get a first idea of how the game preview could look like and to have a starting point for further discussions with the team. This was then developed further by Leo Kling and Jonathan Kron, who created more detailed wireframes and mockups for the home and the level selection screen. I tried as much feedback as possible as I was responsible for the game design part and had to think about the level structure. Therefore I was also deeply involved in the discussion about whether to make a 2D or 3D game.

  Later in this phase I was mainly contributing regarding the level content itself, the story of the game and how to connect those two aspects of the game. After setting up initial levels I was also responsible on working out and designing tutorial levels to introduce the player to the game mechanics and also help him navigate within the system. This was a very important part of the game design, as it was crucial to make the game user-friendly and easy to understand for the player.

  When we had first user tests we realized that we should give a better introduction outside of the game itself. Therefore I designed a tutorial section that goes through the main elements of the game, like buttons, the game and editor window, the node system and so on.

  For the assets I was mainly involved in the discussion about which assets to use and how to integrate them into the game but less involved in the actual creation of the assets.

  Other than that I was somewhat involved in the styling of the landing page and the game window when necessary.

  === Development<markus_dev_phase>

  The development was kind of rough and slow in the beginning, which for me was mainly due to two reasons: First, during the project planning phase we as a team agreed on setting up the development environment all together so everyone knows how to setup the project on his computer and so all teammembers are certain about the architecture of the project. However, due to the lack of communication this didn't work out as planned. The second reason I was slow on the game development at the beginning was because I was part of the game design and game creation time but not the node team. This meant that I had to wait for the node team to get basic functionality in nodes done in order to be able to test the game node interaction.
  However, I used the time to work my self into the kaplay game engine to get a better understanding of how to use it and how to make it interact with the nodes. This also gave me a perspective on what levels are actually possible and how to implement them.

  In the first weeks of development I also tried to give feedback and work on the landing page including the level selection part. I for example worked on the level navigation and made sure that the levels are displayed correctly.Simultaneously I was working on smaller parts of the landing page such as the visual feedback when hovering over certain elements such as buttons.

  More to the end of the project I was a little bit involved in the documentation part even though I was not assigned to it. I checked for content and typos and put in a little bit of content myself, the most part was done by Leo Kling though.

  === Time Management<markus_time_management>

  My plan was to spend a few hours almost each day a week instead of only working like one day a week but the whole day.

  As mentioned in the @markus_dev_phase section , the first weeks were difficult to manage properly. But I was able to catch up on that time schedule at the beginning of May and therefore had to make a couple more hours in order to catch up the time I missed before.
  At that point I already started with the game development part so It was always easy to get stuff done and not have to search for tasks. This was especially due to the fact that we used Github issues to track our tasks and their importantness. This made it easier to prioritize tasks and to see what needs to be done next and who is currently assigned to which task.

  Later in the project while having meetings with Mr. Gr√ºnvogel about the project progress we also discussed our time tracking methods and came to the conclusion that actual time tracking by using a google sheet for example could help us a lot in order to keep track of how much time we spent in general and on which tasks.
  This was especially helpful for me to have actual numbers on the time spent.
  It might sound silly but it also kind of motivated me to work more on the project so I can type in more hours into the sheet, also because I had the comparison to the other team members.

  Especially at the end of June I decided to work a lot more hours than inteded per week in order to pre-work for my missing time during the summer school. This way I spend over 30 hours on a single week regarding the google docs sheet which of course was kind of tight respecting the other project and also my personal schedule. But this was important to me as I knew Im going to miss a couple weeks of the project and my team would have to be fine without me for that time.

  The one thing I couldn't make up for was the final presentation which was prepared and held right in the middle of the summer school program. I wanted to be part of the presentation as a part of the team but unfortunately wasn't able to attend it.

  When coming back at the middle of July I was not deeply involved in the documentation part yet as descibed in the @markus_documentation section.
  So I wanted to make sure that I can contribute a significant amount of time to the project in order to catch up on the documentation part as well as this was meant to be done by the whole team until the end of July.

  At that time the project was already declared as finished so I was able to spend all my working time left on the documentation part.

  === Documentation<markus_documentation>

  I was taking part in the documentation part of the draft for the final web report and contributed a solid amount of work to this task. After that we then decided to already start with the main documentation phase in order to write the final reports for the project. At that time I was not deeply involved in the documentation as we still had to finish the levels of the game. Later in June I had to leave my team for a couple weeks due to the summer school program in Japan. Therefore I was not able to contribute to the project in any way during that time.
  This was already agreed with the rest of the team at the beginning of the project, so eventhough it was kind of rough to have one less team member during that time, we had to make it work.
  This led to me having to manage my time differently to the other team members which you can read in the @markus_time_management section.

  As I spend more time on the project before the summer school, I also wanted to catch up on the documentation part after I came back. Therefore I tried to spend as much time as possible during the last weeks of the project as we as a team agreed on finishing the project including the poster and the final reports by the end of July. This was a very tight schedule, but we wanted to make it work.
