  == Contributions of Markus Heming

  I was the one who came up with the initial idea for this project eventhough I declined to take the project lead. As we decided to mainly devide the project into two main parts, the node team and the game development team, I decided to put my main effort into the game development part as I I found it more suiting to my skills and interests.

  Besides the work packages that were assigned to the whole group I was mainly responsible for the `Game Design` and `Game Creation` part. So this was about the concept and design of the game, the development of the game itself and filling it with story. Later during the process I was also working on making the game as user-friendly as possible.

  Especially in the beginning I was kind of reliant on the progress of the node team in order to dive deeper into the game development part. This led to an uneven distribution of work in the beginning, which I had to compensate later on. Additionally to the higher time effort the main weight of the game progress was on my shoulders, due to the fact that members of the game development team had to work on other parts of the project as well and some lack of communication.

  In the following sections especially the @markus_dev_phase I'll focus more on the progress and the work I put into the project. This includes challenges I faced and also learnings I made during the project.

  === Time Tracking Methodology <markus_time_methodology>

  Similar to the other team members I tried to not overestimate my time spent on tasks and rather focus on actual time spent. For example as I was responsible for the game design part I tried to not count the time I spent on thinking about the game design in general, but rather only the time I spent on actually writing down the design and concept. This way I tried to get a more realistic view of my time spent on tasks.
  Due to this approach I also tried to not count the time spent on discussions with other team members when not actively working on the project.

  Later during the project the whole team agreed on using a google sheet to track our time and the tasks we worked on during that time. This made it easier to keep track of your own time and also to see what other team members are currently working on. Additionally it made it easier to see how much time was spent on each task and to identify potential bottlenecks in the project.

  At the end I also used the the same Git-based time tracking tool, described in @jonathan_time_methodology, to track my time spent on the programming and documentation tasks.
