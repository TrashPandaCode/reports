== Contributions of Milan Jezovsek
The following outlines my contributions to the project throughout its various phases, including planning, concept and design, development, and documentation. While the work was collaborative and many tasks were shared among team members, I focused on specific areas where I could bring the most value. In the following sections, I will describe my involvement in each phase, highlighting both the responsibilities I was assigned and the areas where I took initiative. My contributions ranged from collaborative design and UI/UX work to implementing features and handling technical challenges during development.

Initially assigned to the a variety of work packages, I later focused on the `Node Types`, `Node Execution`, `Help Tool`, and `UI/UX Overall` work packages. My contributions were not limited to these areas, as I also supported my teammates in other aspects of the project whenever possible. However, due to the nature of our collaboration, I often found myself working independently, reviewing existing work and determining how I could best contribute to the project.

It should be noted that my contributions were not always reflected in the final codebase, as many of my early implementations were reworked or replaced by other team members. And my contributions are not as plentyful as some of my teammates, as I failed to keep up with the pace of development and managed my time inefficiently. However, I believe that my work in the areas I focused on was valuable and helped shape the project in those areas.

=== Project Planning<milan_project_planning>
In the first weeks of the project we all worked on the `Project Planning` together. During this time we discussed the overall structure of the project, the technologies we wanted to use and how we wanted to approach the development of the project. We also discussed the timeline of the project and how we wanted to split up the work into different work packages. We collaborated on a variety of documents, including the `Projektauftragsformular`, `Projektorganisation`, and `Projektplanung`, as well as corresponding presentations for each stage. I contributed wherever I could and supported my teammates in different areas, though I often missed the specific days when most of the core work was completed. As a result, I frequently had to work independently, reviewing what had already been done and figuring out how I could add value to the project on my own.

=== Concept and Design<milan_concept_design>
I was assigned to two major work packages concerning the concept and design of the project. The first of which was the `First Prototype` and the second was the `UI/UX Overall` workpackage.

Jonathan Kron shared the `Figma` document we used for collaborative design and concept work on the 26th of March, allthough I do not remember the exact day I started working in it. My first contributions to the `First Prototype` were together with Jonathan Kron, where we built a first draft of the `NodeEditor` and `Game` UI side by side. I was very adamant that these two components should be resizeable, as I wanted to ensure the user could focus on the part of the UI they were currently working on. This was no Issue though as the team agreed with this design idea and we implemented it in the first prototype. We went a little overboard with the first drafts as they already had colors radii and other design elements and we only wanted to think about layout first. Therfore I took the first drafts and stripped them down to their bare bones, removing all styling and colors. I also designed a simple pause screen and tried to make most of these designs into reusable `Figma` components. The components were not of much help to the rest of the team though as they felt it easier to just work on the fly. Jonathan Kron took the stripped wireframe for the `NodeEditor` and `GameView` i had built and fleshed out the `Help` section. Meanwhile Markus Heming and Jonathan Kron had also built wireframes for a level overview and a home screen for the game. At this point the decision was made, that we needed a landing page for our website, which was then drafted by Leo Kling and Jonathan Kron. During this time we also discussed color schemes and in how many dimensions we wanted the game to take place. I contributed to these discussions by suggesting a color scheme inspired by the colors of the `TH KÃ¶ln` and one schemes utilizing purplish tones. I also advocated for a 2.5D or isometric game, as I quite like the aesthetics of such games. However, we ultimately decided to go with a 2D game, as this is both easier for us o develop and for the user to understand coordinates. The color scheme we ended up with was one suggested by Leo Kling and Jonathan Kron. After these discussions a more in depth design of the landing page was created by Leo Kling, which i did some minor iterations on. In the end Leo Klings original design was implemented at first and then later refined by Jonathan Kron as a need for a better level selection solution grew apparent.

=== Development<milan_dev_phase>
In the following I will describe my contributions to the development of the project. I will not go into detail about the code itself, but rather focus on the features I worked on and the decisions we made as a team. The code itself can be found in the `GitHub` repository of the project. The Parts of Development i had been officially assigne to were the following workpackages: `Node Types`, `Node Execution`, `Help Tool` and `UI/UX Overall`, the last of which was also part of @milan_concept_design since it included both the design and the implementation of it.

==== April<milan_dev_april>
In the second half of April I started working on development. My first contribution to development was together with Leo where we thought about the practicality of our routing. We came to the conclusion that we needed to send the different routes only when they were specifically requested by the user. This way we ensure that the user does not have to wait for unnecessary data to be loaded (e.g. loading the game route when the user wants to look at the documentation). Before coming to this conclusion we had set up some rudimentary routes which were then scrapped and Leo implemented `React-Router` in such a way that we could package each route individually.

In the end of April I then started work on some early nodes. First of which was the `Display` node. The `Display` node enables the user to display any value they connect to it. I designed this to help the user debug their graphs or simply display values they want to see. Working on the `Display` node the realization struck, that we needed to abstract the styling and layout of the nodes. This is where I started working on the node Layout. To do this I created three components: `Header`, `Body` and `Footer`. The `Header` held the title and some meta data about the node, the Body held the content of the node and the `Footer` was mostly a placeholder. After this I did some maintenance and structuring work on the code base. From which I returned to the `Display` node, refining it's layout and styling. Which then led me to do the same for our new `Addition` and `Value` nodes, that existed at that point and did not yet use our node components.

After this I spend the remaining days of April touching up styling where needed and ensured consistency across the nodes, our homepage and the UI for selecting multiple nodes with shift and mouse drag. The only little detour I took was to help Philipp with the proper placement of a node when spawned via the node editors context menu.

As with my work on routing which has been improved by Leo Kling, most of this work is not present in the current version of the code base anymore, as it was reworked by different members of the team. Noteably the `Addition` note has been scrapped and replaced with the `Math` node, written by Jonathan Kron. The other mentioned nodes have either been adjusted or were scrapped all together. The node layout has been reworked and is now only one component called `NodeContent`.

==== May<milan_dev_may>
I started of May, by writing a custom dropdown component for our `Math` node's `computeType` selection menu. This component would put each category of `computeTypes` into a submenu inside of the `Math` node's dropdown menu. I did this to in my opinion simplyfy the flow of searching a node. Instead of having to look through a long list of nodes, the user could now open a dropdown and only search the category they want to look at.

On the 4th of May I worked to include `computeTypes` into the `PaneContextMenu`'s search functionality. This way the user could type in the name of a `computeType` and it would show up in the search results. And when the user selected it, it would be added to the `NodeEditor` as a `Math` node with the corresponding `computType` selected. And I also wrote some first drafts of content for the documentation of the `Display` and `Time` node.

The 5th of May marked the start of my journey into the `Group` node. I started by writing a `Group` node that would allow the user to group nodes together by dragging them into the `Group` node. This was a first draft and purely aesthetic. However, I hoped to gain knowledge about the grouping behaviour of `react-flow` and how that might translate into a node that would allow the user to loop certain parts of their graph.

On the 6th of May I had a first version of the logic that handles adding, removing, moving inside as well as between `Group` nodes. As hinted by this being a first version, it was not yet perfect and I had to revisit this code numerous times during the project's development.

On the 10th of May I continued working on the `Group` node, this time focusing on the UI. I adjusted our `NodeContent` component to show a different background color when the node is a group, to ensure that nodes are visually identifieable inside the group. I also made the `Group` node resizable, using `react-flow`'s resize component's and added a hint while the group is empty. All of this was to ensure that the user could easily identify a group node, understand how to use it and adjusts it to their liking.

// both went our own ways? cant think of a better phrase rn
In between these workdays I had consulted with Jonerthan Kron about our approach to implementing a loop node. After we brainstormed a bit and exchanged ideas on how the loop node should look and behave, we both went our own ways again. And when I returned Jonerthan had built the `ForLoop` which consists of the `ForStart` and `ForEnd` nodes.

// cognitive load... is this mean to jonerthan?
On the 15th of May I styled the UI of the `ForLoop` to adhere to the styles of other nodes and simplify the cognitive load for the user. Especially the UI for adding custom `Handles` to the `ForLoop` was hard to understand and I wanted to make it as intuitive as possible. I also added the possibility to delete custom `Handles` by clicking on an `x` that appears whren they are hovered over with the mouse pointer. This was a feature that was missing in the first version of the `ForLoop` and I wanted to ensure that the user could easily remove custom `Handles` if they were not needed anymore. After this I tried to help out with a problem concerning the sorting of the node graph regarading the `ForLoop` nodes. The Problem was that computing a `ForEnd` node before its corresponding `ForStart` node would lead to an error and we did not handle that case yet. Therefore i devised an idea together with Philipp Wendt and left it as comments in the code base. The Issue was then solved by Jonathan Kron.

On May 20th I worked to integrate the `Group` node with our other systems. I reworked the `duplciateNode` function of the `NodeContextMenu` to ensure that it would duplicate the `Group` node and all of its children. I then reworked the `deleteNode` function such that when a `Group` node is deleted, all of its children are also deleted. I also stopped `Group` nodes from being added into the compute graph, since they do not have any computational implications. After which I started modifying the resize logic for `Group` nodes. Jonerthan had already implemented a resize logic that would ensure that the `Group` node would resize to fit all of its children. However, this did not include all edgecases and we wanted to also limit the user from resizing the `Group` node to a size that would not fit all of its children.

On May 21st I started work on building a robust duplication function in our `utilities` as we needed such functionality in many places and our current implementations were lacking and had many edgecases with weird and unintuitive behaviour. By the end of the day I had a first version of the duplication function that would duplicate a set of nodes with respect to their child and parent, this was still very much in progress though.

On the 22nd of May i added most of the logic for duplicating `ForLoops` and their children. This Implementation still had Issues and I improved it's handling of children and their parents by the end of the day, but duplicating loops was still not functioning correctly.

On the 23rd of May I continued working on the duplication logic, I expanded the logic to handle the state of a given `ForLoop`, ergo the custom `Handles` that were added to the `ForLoop`. Afterwards i debugged and fixed a problem with selecting nodes, where selecting a node would not toggle correctly when duplicating and nodes had to sometimes be selected multiple times or their selection was inverted. And finally I created constants for the default sizes of the `Group` node and refactored all refrences accordingly.

On the 25th I revisited the `duplicateNodes` and the `computeGroupSizings`functions. For the `duplicateNodes` function I adjusted parenting behaviiours once again and then added the default case for nodes that fall outside of groups, loops and children. After this I deemed this the first usable or stable version of the `duplicateNodes` function. I then moved on to the `computeGroupSizings` function, having it return the default sizes when the group is empty.

On the 26th of May I basically rewrote the `onNodeDragstop` function, which determines when and how to add nodes to a `Group`, once more and hoped it to be ready this time. I refactored more of our code to make use of the `duplicateNodes` function and adjusted our logic for adding nodes to a `ForLoop` to also add these nodes to the `ForLoop`'s parent, if it has one. Afterwards i adjusted the `duplicateNodes` function once more to ensure proper handling of `Handles` and refactored more refrences to this funcion.

On the 27th I realized that the `onNodeDragstop` function was still not working as intended and started another rewrite.

I continued this rewrite on the 28th of May and finished it early on. I then moved to refactor more code regarding the `duplicateNodes` function. This included changes to the `AddNodes` component, the `NodeContextMenu` and `SelectionContextMenu`, as well as the `duplicateNodes`function itself. Afterwards it finally looked like I was on the home stretch regarding my feature branch for the `Group` nodes, which now also contained the new diplicate logic.

On the 29th of May I started work by fixing an issue with the `duplicateNodes` function, where duplicating a loop and its children while they were in two seperate groups would parent all children to the `ForStart`'s parent. At this point the `duplicateNodes` function was rather unwildy as one needed to pass a lot of functions into it, but Jonerthan Kron showed me that i could directly interact with our zustand stores state and get most functionality i needed from there. I then used this knowledge the `duplicateNodes` function accordingly. I also adjusted the deletion behaviour of the `Group` node to unparent all children rather than deleting them. We had came to the conclusion that deleting children of a `Group` was unintuitive and very destrucitve, especially since we did not have undo functionality at that point. Afterwards with the approval of most team members and reviews by Jonathan Kron and Leo Kling I merged my feature branch into the main branch.

This marked the end of my work in May. Most of my work in May was focused on the `Group` node and the `duplicateNodes` function. It should be noted that my earlier work in May on the custom dropdown component was scrapped, as it introduced more clicks to the user flow and broke the keyboard navigation of the dropdown menu with no straight forward fix available. And that the functionality for searching `computeTypes` and directly adding the corresponding note later expanded and reworked.

==== June<milan_dev_june>
In June I assigned myself for the task of implementing unit tests for our code base. I started by reading and learning about unit tests, Jest, React Testing Library and how to test zustand stores. I then started experimenting with writing a test for our `game-store` but ran into issues rather quickly. I talked about this a lot with Jonathan Kron who tried helping me, but I was uanble to get these tests running on my own. I then wrote a test together with Jonathan Kron for the `data-store` which was a lot more successful. But we ultimately ran into issues with correctly mocking the `localStorage` and the `zustand` stores. Jonathan Kron then fixed these issues on his own. This marked the end of my contributions to the unit tests, as well as development in general on the 13th of June.

=== Personal Reflections<milan_reflections>
I learned a lot during this project, both about myself and about software development. I learned that I need to be more proactive in my work and that I need to manage my time better. I also learned that I need to be more communicative with my team and that I need to explicitly ask for help when I need it. In retrospective I rarely felt like i was working with the team even though I value each member personally. I also learned a lot about the technologies we used, especially React, Zustand and React Flow. I am proud of the work I did on the `Group` node and the `duplicateNodes` function. I also learned a lot about the importance of planning a project. Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me and I am grateful for the opportunity to work on it.

For future projects I would like to work more with the team and be more proactive in my work.
