=== Project Planning<philipp_project_planning>

Like the other members of the group, I spent crucial time on planning, early prototypes, concepts and other aspects of the early project phases. The following however will be based on my work during the development phase and how the ways I contributed changed over the course of the project and how they differed from the initial planning.

After initial planning, I decided to participate in the project as a part of the `Visual Scripting` team, laying the focus of my work on the node system and its corresponding components. Additionally, I was assigned to the following work packages: `Proof of Concept`, `Node Types`, `Node Execution`, `Unit Tests`, `User Testing` and `Help Tool`.

=== Concept and Design<philipp_concept_design>

During the concept and design phase, as well as the other team members, I was involved in the creation of the initial look and feel of the application as well as the design and draft of the node system and its components. This phase was crucial for later development, as it laid the groundwork for the visual scripting system and its usability. We created initial prototypes and sketches, which were then refined into a more concrete design that would guide our development efforts and affect @philipp_dev_phase.

=== Development<philipp_dev_phase>
During the very early stages of the project, I was actually working on the `Node Types` and `Node Execution` work packages as planned in @philipp_project_planning, but as the project progressed, I quickly fell behind due to my own time mismanagement and general lack of constructive communication within the team. This led to multiple frustrating situations concerning work load imbalances within the team, that had to be resolved by myself as well as the other team members.

After having resolved most of these issues, the `Node Types` and `Node Execution` work packages were merged and mostly finished and being actively worked on by Jonathan Kron, which resulted in me only administering minor changes to the node system and its components. This led to most of my work being focused on work that needed to be done on top of the node system, such as user accessibility and interfaces through menus or keyboard shortcuts like Copy and Paste as well as their respective underlying logic.

Having fallen behind on the general amount of work needed to be done from me, I had a lot of catching up to do, which resulted in me not working on `Unit Tests` and dropping the stretch goal of implementing an `AI Help Tool` due to time constraints. I instead focused on my yet to be finished tasks and conducting significant research for the upcoming documentation phase, which I was able to complete in a timely manner.

With the project nearing its conclusion, I concentrated on finishing the last remaining tasks assigned to me, such as polishing the shortcut functionality as well as simplification of general key registration for our app. To then conduct a sufficient amount of user testing as well as creating a written definition of our didactic concept for my documentation work as mentioned in @philipp_documentation which both were originally planned to be done way earlier during the development phase, but were falling behind due to the aforementioned issues. /*This user testing was conducted with a small group of people, who were able to provide valuable feedback on the usability of the application and its components, which I was then able to concentrate into final polishing changes for the project.*/
//inshallah this will work out to be true
=== Documentation<philipp_documentation>

// Finally, I also contributed to the documentation phase, where I was able to write a significant amount of the documentation, documenting my own efforts and development phase (@philipp_dev_phase) and help with the final touches of the project. This included writing the final report, which was a collaborative effort with the other team members, and ensuring that all aspects of the project were well-documented and presented in a clear and concise manner.

// this is also a stretch for now, but im confident this will be true by the end of the project
