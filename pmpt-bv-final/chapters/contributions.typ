  === Project Phase

  During the project implementation phase, my contributions included the comprehensive collection and curation of real-world acoustic and image data, establishing a foundation for the reverberation time estimation system. This involved systematic gathering of room impulse responses and corresponding RT60 measurements across diverse office rooms. Following data collection, I conducted data analysis to ensure the data was not faulty.

  The model training phase constituted a significant portion of my technical contributions, where I implemented and optimized convolutional neural network architectures. This involved systematic experimentation with various CNN configurations, including transfer learning approaches utilizing pre-trained models such as Places365-trained ResNet architectures. Additionally, I conducted comprehensive model analysis to evaluate performance and robustness, including systematic assessment of prediction accuracy across different captured environments.

  === Documentation Phase

  My documentation contributions included both theoretical exposition and analysis presentation. I provided comprehensive explanations of neural network fundamentals and deep learning principles. I contributed significantly to the structural organization of the technical report and, in collaboration with Leo, co-authored the dataset section documenting data collection procedures and preprocessing methodologies.

  Additionally, I focused on comprehensive explanation of experimental procedures and results. I contributed to expanding the related works section through literature review of relevant research in acoustic parameter estimation and machine learning applications in room acoustics. Finally, I made contributions to the discussion section, providing critical analysis of results, identification of limitations, and suggestions for future research directions.
