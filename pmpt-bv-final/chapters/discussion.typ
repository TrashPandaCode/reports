= Discussion

The development and evaluation of our neural network system for RT60 estimation from single room images revealed several critical insights into the feasibility and limitations of image-based acoustic prediction. This discussion examines the challenges encountered, analyzes the relationship between our findings and existing literature, and explores potential pathways for improving single-image RT60 estimation accuracy.

== Image-Based RT60 Prediction Capabilities

Our experimental results demonstrate that while images contain acoustically relevant information, the extraction of precise frequency-dependent RT60 values from single photographs presents significant challenges under current methodological constraints. The limited dataset of approximately 3,300 images proved insufficient for training a robust convolutional neural network capable of learning complex acoustic-visual relationships. Consequently, our model's predictions appeared to reflect random variation rather than meaningful acoustic estimation, highlighting the critical importance of dataset scale in deep learning applications for specialized domains.

Interestingly, our simplified shoebox model experiment, which eschewed frequency-dependent analysis in favor of basic room size correlation with overall reverberation characteristics, demonstrated some predictive capability. While the model successfully identified that larger rooms generally exhibit longer reverberation times, the proportional relationships remained imprecise and lacked the quantitative accuracy required for practical acoustic applications. This finding suggests that certain fundamental acoustic-visual correlations are indeed learnable from images, but require more sophisticated approaches to achieve meaningful predictive performance.

== Comparison with Existing Approaches

Our findings contrast significantly with the success reported in prior work, particularly the study by Milne et al., which achieved 90.90% accuracy at 500 Hz using 24 RGB photographs per room. This substantial performance difference can be attributed to several methodological distinctions. First, their multi-image approach provided comprehensive spatial coverage of each room, capturing diverse viewing angles and lighting conditions that likely contained complementary acoustic information. Our single-image constraint inherently limited the spatial information available to the network, potentially excluding critical visual cues related to room geometry and surface materials.

The frequency-specific approach employed by Milne et al., focusing exclusively on 500 Hz, also contrasts with our broader frequency range analysis across six octave bands. While frequency-dependent estimation provides more comprehensive acoustic characterization, it significantly increases the complexity of the learning task, potentially requiring exponentially larger datasets to achieve comparable accuracy.

Similarly, the AV-RIR framework's multimodal approach, combining visual and auditory inputs, demonstrated superior performance but at the cost of increased data collection complexity. The integration of audio recordings with visual data provides direct acoustic information that supplements visual cues, creating a more robust foundation for RT60 estimation. However, such approaches deviate from our objective of purely visual-based prediction and would require significant modifications to our data collection methodology.

== Dataset Composition and Quality Considerations

The hybrid nature of our dataset, combining real-world measurements from TH Köln office environments with synthetically generated room configurations, introduced complex training dynamics that likely impacted model performance. The substantial domain gap between synthetic and real images created a challenging multi-domain learning environment where the network struggled to develop unified representations applicable to both visual modalities.

*Real vs. Synthetic Data Trade-offs*: Real-world data provides authentic visual-acoustic relationships and represents the target domain for model deployment. However, our real-world dataset, while diverse in room configurations, remained limited in scale and potentially biased toward specific architectural styles and furnishing patterns characteristic of academic office environments. The variability in image quality due to different mobile devices and lighting conditions may have introduced additional noise that complicated the learning process.

Conversely, synthetic data offers several theoretical advantages for training stability and scalability. The controlled generation environment ensures consistent image quality, lighting conditions, and precise correspondence between visual appearance and acoustic parameters. The ability to systematically vary room dimensions, material properties, and furnishing configurations could enable more comprehensive coverage of the acoustic parameter space. However, the visual artifacts and stylistic differences inherent in rendered images limit the model's ability to generalize to real-world photography.

*Dataset Scale Requirements*: The fundamental limitation of approximately 3,300 datapoints becomes apparent when compared to successful computer vision applications, which typically require orders of magnitude more training samples. Given the complexity of acoustic-visual relationships and the high-dimensional nature of image data, effective training likely necessitates datasets containing tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of room-image pairs. This scale requirement presents significant practical challenges for real-world data collection but could potentially be addressed through expanded synthetic generation pipelines.

== Architectural and Methodological Improvements

The current CNN architecture, while following established computer vision practices, may not be optimally configured for extracting acoustically relevant visual features. Several architectural modifications could potentially improve performance:

*Multi-Scale Feature Extraction*: Acoustic properties depend on both fine-grained surface textures and large-scale spatial configurations. Implementing multi-scale convolutional architectures or attention mechanisms could better capture these diverse spatial relationships. Features such as surface material texture patterns require high-resolution analysis, while room geometry assessment benefits from broader spatial context.

*Frequency-Specific Network Branches*: Rather than predicting all frequency bands simultaneously, employing separate network branches for different frequency ranges could allow for specialized feature learning. Low-frequency RT60 values primarily depend on room volume and large-scale geometry, while high-frequency characteristics are more sensitive to surface materials and fine architectural details.

*Transfer Learning and Pretraining*: Leveraging pretrained networks from related computer vision tasks, such as scene understanding or material classification, could provide better initialization for acoustic prediction. Networks pretrained on room layout estimation or surface material recognition might contain relevant feature representations that accelerate convergence and improve generalization.

== Alternative Data Collection Strategies

Several approaches could address the current dataset limitations:

*Expanded Real-World Collection*: Systematic data collection across diverse building types, architectural styles, and geographic regions could provide a more representative dataset. However, this approach requires significant time investment and coordination with building owners, limiting scalability.

*Improved Synthetic Generation*: Advanced rendering techniques, including more sophisticated lighting models, procedural texture generation, and physics-based material aging, could reduce the domain gap between synthetic and real images. Integration with architectural design software could enable generation of more realistic room configurations based on actual building plans.

*Hybrid Training Strategies*: Domain adaptation techniques, such as adversarial training or style transfer methods, could potentially bridge the synthetic-real domain gap while leveraging the scalability advantages of synthetic data generation. Alternatively, progressive training strategies that begin with synthetic data and gradually incorporate real-world samples might improve convergence stability.

== Limitations and Future Directions

The current approach faces several fundamental limitations that suggest directions for future research:

*Single-Image Constraint*: While maintaining the single-image input constraint aligns with practical deployment scenarios, relaxing this limitation to incorporate multiple viewpoints or panoramic images could significantly improve prediction accuracy. The trade-off between data collection complexity and prediction performance requires careful consideration based on intended application requirements.

*Frequency-Independent Modeling*: Our shoebox model results suggest that simplified, frequency-independent RT60 estimation might be more tractable with limited datasets. Future work could explore hierarchical approaches that first establish basic acoustic characteristics before refining frequency-specific predictions.

*Multimodal Integration as Fallback*: While maintaining focus on single-image prediction, incorporating minimal audio information—such as brief ambient recordings or simple acoustic measurements—could provide fallback capabilities when visual-only prediction fails. Such hybrid systems could automatically determine when additional modalities are necessary for reliable estimation.

== Broader Implications

The challenges encountered in this project reflect broader issues in specialized deep learning applications where domain-specific datasets are inherently limited. The acoustic prediction domain exemplifies scenarios where theoretical feasibility exists—as demonstrated by human ability to make acoustic judgments from visual cues—but practical implementation requires careful consideration of data requirements, architectural choices, and evaluation methodologies.

The domain gap between synthetic and real data represents a recurring challenge in computer vision applications where real-world data collection is expensive or impractical. Our experience suggests that while synthetic data can supplement limited real-world datasets, substantial effort must be invested in closing the domain gap to achieve meaningful performance improvements.

== Conclusion

Our investigation demonstrates that single-image RT60 estimation remains a challenging but potentially achievable objective. While current results indicate insufficient performance for practical deployment, the fundamental correlations between visual appearance and acoustic properties suggest that improved methodologies could yield meaningful results. Success likely requires substantial increases in dataset scale, architectural innovations specifically designed for acoustic-visual learning, and careful consideration of the trade-offs between data collection complexity and prediction accuracy.

Future work should prioritize dataset expansion through improved synthetic generation techniques, exploration of transfer learning approaches from related computer vision domains, and systematic evaluation of architectural modifications designed for acoustic prediction tasks. The development of robust single-image RT60 estimation would represent a significant advance in practical acoustic modeling with applications in architectural design, audio production, and immersive media development.
