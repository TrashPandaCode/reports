= Machine Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's) represent a specialized class of deep learning neural networks particularly well-suited for processing grid-like data structures such as images. The fundamental architecture of CNN's leverages three key principles: local connectivity, parameter sharing, and translation equivariance, which make them highly effective for computer vision tasks such as our reverberation time estimation from images. Unlike traditional fully connected networks, CNN's employ convolutional layers that apply learnable filters across input data, enabling the network to detect local features such as edges, textures and spatial patterns while maintaining computational efficiency.

The typical CNN architecture consists of alternating convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers for classification or regression tasks. Convolutional layers perform feature extraction through the application of multiple filters, each learning to detect specific patterns in the input data. Pooling layers (commonly max pooling or average pooling) reduce the spatial dimensions while preserving important features, contributing to the network's robustness to small translations and reducing computational overhead. This hierarchical feature learning allows CNN's to capture both low-level features (e.g., edges, corners) in early layers and increasingly higher-level semantic information (e.g., object parts, textures) in deeper layers.
