  author = {Pérez, Ricardo FALCÓN and Götz, Georg and Pulkki, Ville},
  abstract = {This work presents a machine-learning-based method to estimate the reverberation time of a virtual room for auralization purposes. The models take as input geometric features of the room and output the estimated reverberation time values as function of frequency. The proposed model is trained and evaluated using a novel dataset composed of real-world acoustical measurements of a single room with 832 different configurations of furniture and absorptive materials, for multiple loudspeaker positions. The method achieves a prediction accuracy of approximately 90\% for most frequency bands. Furthermore, when comparing against the Sabine and Eyring methods, the proposed approach exhibits a much higher accuracy, especially at low frequencies.},

  abstract = {We propose a technique for producing "visual explanations" for decisions from a large class of CNN-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Grad-CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers, (2) CNNs used for structured outputs, (3) CNNs used in tasks with multimodal inputs or reinforcement learning, without any architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization and apply it to off-the-shelf image classification, captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into their failure modes, (b) are robust to adversarial images, (c) outperform previous methods on localization, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model and (e) help achieve generalization by identifying dataset bias. For captioning and VQA, we show that even non-attention based models can localize inputs. We devise a way to identify important neurons through Grad-CAM and combine it with neuron names to provide textual explanations for model decisions. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM helps users establish appropriate trust in predictions from models and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a 'stronger' nodel from a 'weaker' one even when both make identical predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/ramprs/grad-cam/, along with a demo at http://gradcam.cloudcv.org, and a video at youtu.be/COjUB9Izk6E.}
