  author = {Pérez, Ricardo FALCÓN and Götz, Georg and Pulkki, Ville},
  abstract = {This work presents a machine-learning-based method to estimate the reverberation time of a virtual room for auralization purposes. The models take as input geometric features of the room and output the estimated reverberation time values as function of frequency. The proposed model is trained and evaluated using a novel dataset composed of real-world acoustical measurements of a single room with 832 different configurations of furniture and absorptive materials, for multiple loudspeaker positions. The method achieves a prediction accuracy of approximately 90\% for most frequency bands. Furthermore, when comparing against the Sabine and Eyring methods, the proposed approach exhibits a much higher accuracy, especially at low frequencies.},
